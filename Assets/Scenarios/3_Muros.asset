  scenarioIntroStrings:
  - The air hung deadly still and quiet.
  - A soft rustling of cloth was heard.
  - 'From a dark corner of the non-euclidean marble hallway, the silhouette of its
    incomprehensible form staggered into view. '
  - The hero reeled in terror. Unsettling images of an infinite black expanse filled
    his mind.
  - '"You," Muros'' ragged voice creaked, "have come before your time."'
  - The hero turned on his heel to run-- but, at the last moment, a flicker of courage--
  - Why was it he felt there was something he absolutely had to accomplish?
  - The hero stood to face the cloaked figure and look it in the eye.
