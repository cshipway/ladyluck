  scenarioIntroStrings:
  - Chains drug across the sundered ground so large that the sound of their scraping
    nearly deafened the hero.
  - 'A voice like lightning boomed out, defying human comprehension:'
  - '"So, then! It''s time to see how long it will take to lay this ridiculous wager
    to rest!"'
  - Ralderbahn charged!

  - The earth shuddered violently when the Mountain King fell the colossal height
    from his throne to the hard ground.
  - '"This... isn''t possible..." he managed to spit out before slipping into that
    state between immortality and non-being.'
  - '"A most unexpected development for our little wager, wouldn''t you say, Ralderbahn?"
    Fortuna gloated.'
  - '"It''ll be a while before he gets up. Now, go, my champion -- there are more
    gods to surpass!"'
  - The hero trekked on, this time, with more aplomb in each step.
