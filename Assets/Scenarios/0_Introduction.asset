  - Our story begins on the celestial plane where the constellations shimmer and
    the gods reside in their perpetual and well-deserved dominion. (Click to continue.
    [S] key to skip intro.)
  - It was a typical congregation of the greater deities, who had succumbed as usual
    to their favorite pastime of arguing about mortals.
  - 'Today the topic of dispute was something like this: what most are the traits
    that elevate a man to greatness?'
  - 'Ralderbahn, the god of frenzied rage and indomitable strength, held firm in
    the matter:'
  - '"Barring doubt and without question, ''tis the fearsome might to shatter stone
    and cleave mountains!"'
  - 'Muros, the gatekeeper of the abyss, spoke rarely but spoke now:'
  - '"''Tis swift cunning, swift as the shadows which reclaim what the light stole
    just soon as the candle is snuffed."'
  - 'Reletrix, whose unblinking eye sees further than his many-armed reach is long,
    stated matter-of-factly:'
  - '"You are both wrong. ''Tis, of course, the sharp twinkling of intellect, cold
    and bright like the Shiver Star, which gives way to the greatest deeds."'
  - 'But the gods stood surprised when a fourth voice called out, interrupting their
    trial in a most unwelcome manner:'
  - '"None of you have the right of it!"'
  - The visages of the greater ones turned to scowl at their guest, who stepping
    into the light of the fiery spheres revealed herself as Fortuna, the mere lesser
    god of luck.
  - '"Return at once to your inferior plane," hissed Reletrix, "and to your menial
    duties of declaring how fall the bones thrown."'
  - The other gods nodded in agreement.
  - 'Yet, she continued: "Neither might nor swiftness nor intellect shall suffice
    for greatness, without my say-so."'
  - '"Rather, ''tis most the smile of circumstance -- that is, my favor -- which
    best rises a man to dizzying heights."'
  - The hall was in uproar. The three in bellows conspired to throw out the intruder,
    which would have cast a white arc that pierced the firmament, but--
  - Fortuna asked, "If so sure you three are of your lofty claims, and so convinced
    of the absurdity of mine, then why not put it to a wager?"
  - The bellows ceased and the stars for some time shone in silence. She had known
    that the one thing no god could resist was a wager.
  - '"What kind of wager?" murmured Ralderbahn, as Reletrix stroked his chin thoughtfully.'
  - And so begins our tale, but now in earnest...
