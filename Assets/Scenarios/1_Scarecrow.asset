  scenarioIntroStrings:
  - Having chosen her hero, the goddess watched bemusedly as the hapless lad stumbled
    onto a plot of ordinary farmland.
  - '"This scarecrow should suffice as a training dummy for my soon-to-be champion,"
    she resolved.'
  - The lad regarded the patchwork person with a sense of awe and terror, seemingly
    not relieved that it lacked any obvious ability to retaliate in the impending
    bout.
  - '"Even so, the scarecrow does seem fairly well-made... I hope my disciple doesn''t
    simply tire himself out trying to destroy it."'
  - The hero lifted a trembling blade as the goddess began her handiwork...

  - 'Hero has added a new card to his deck: Opening Gambit!'
  - Hero takes a page out of the scarecrow's playbook... Hero has added Mend to his
    deck!
  - ...
  - With a flash of Ty'rixian sunsteel, the durable dummy lay at last in tatters.
  - The alleged hero heaved a sigh of relief. The goddess merely smiled.
  - '"I should think my champion is ready now to face his proper destiny," she resolved.'
  - The hapless boy, led on by the irresistible tug of fate, started to tread towards
    that spot on the horizon where the blood red sun dipped below blackened earth.
  - Ralderbahn, the god of frenzied rage and indomitable strength, he had heard,
    was not known for his hospitable treatment of guests...
